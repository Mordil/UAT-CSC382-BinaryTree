# UAT-CSC382-BinaryTree

One of [University of Advancing Technology's](http://www.uat.edu/) "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CSC382) course weekly assignment.

The intention is to implement the `BinaryTree` data structure with supporting methods for searching, adding, and removing nodes.

## Course Description

> This course explores the specification and implementation of containers as abstract data types. Structures covered include strings, vectors, stacks, queues, sequential lists, binary trees, hashes and graphs. The course also investigates algorithm design and evaluation, such as sorting, search, recursion and algorithmic analysis. Students will use concepts from calculus within this course.
